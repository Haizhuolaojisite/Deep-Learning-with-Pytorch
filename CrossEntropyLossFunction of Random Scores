If the neural network predicts random scores, what would be its loss function? Let's find it out in PyTorch. 
The neural network is going to have 1000 classes,
each having a random score. 
For ground truth, it will have class 111. Calculate the loss function.


# Import torch and torch.nn
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Initialize logits and ground truth with a tensor containing the number 111
logits = torch.rand(1,1000)
ground_truth = torch.tensor([111])

# Instantiate cross-entropy loss
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Calculate and print the loss
loss = criterion(logits,ground_truth)
print(loss)

<script.py> output:
    tensor(7.4136)
